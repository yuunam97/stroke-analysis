### Description: 
This analysis looks at number of factors that affect the occurence of stroke in patients. EDA and Prediction on stroke was achieved based on these factors. The dataset I used is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle. 

### Tools used for EDA:
- Python (3.12.0)
- Plotly (5.18.0)
- Sklearn (1.3.1)
- Matplotlib (3.8.0)

### Tools used for ML:
- Python (3.12.0)
- Sklearn (1.3.1)
- Matplotlib (3.8.0)
- imblearn (0.0)

### The goal of this project:
- Look at the distribution of factors. 
- How categories themselves and combined affect stroke. 
- Data visualization
- EDA
- Predictive modeling using classification models. 

### What I've learned:
- EDA using Python. 
- Organize coding space. 
- Learned effective data visualization using pie charts, kdeplots, bar charts, etc.
- Classification problem with predictive modeling using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. 
- Also learned that those who are married are more likely to get stroke (according to this dataset)! :satisfied:
